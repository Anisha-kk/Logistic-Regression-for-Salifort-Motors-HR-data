# Predicting Employee Attrition in Salifort Motors
Project done in Google Advanced Data Analytics Specialization
## Overview
The goal of this project is to use Logistic Regression to predict whether an employee will quit the fictious multinational vehicle manufacturing company called Salifort Motors. This project used the data collected by HR from the employees. The logistic regression model achieved precision of 80%, recall of 83%, f1-score of 80% (all weighted averages), and accuracy of 83%, on the test set. The main reason for employee attrition seems to be that the employees are overworked.
## Business Understanding
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don’t know what to do with it. They refer to you as a data analytics professional and ask you to provide data-driven suggestions based on your understanding of the data. They have the following question: what’s likely to make the employee leave the company? If you can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.
## Data Understanding
The dataset can be found on Kaggle. It has been repurposed for this project.  It represents 10 columns of self-reported information from 15000 employees. The following bar graph shows the number of employees who stayed vs number of employees in the dataset who left across various departments:

## Modeling and Evaluation
The classification report shows that the logistic regression model achieved a precision of 79%, recall of 82%, f1-score of 80% (all weighted averages), and accuracy of 82%. However, if it's most important to predict employees who leave, then the scores are significantly lower. It would be better to use tree based modeling methods to evaluate this data.
## Conclusion
This model helps understand whether an employee will leave the company or not.
